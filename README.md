# nvda-sentence-nav
SentenceNav is an NVDA add-on that allows you to read text by sentences, as opposed to by paragraphs or words.
It also adds a keystroke to jump to next or previous text paragraphs - that is a paragraph containing one or more sentences. 
This feature might be useful to quickly find the textual part of a web page or to skip over menus and advertisements.
